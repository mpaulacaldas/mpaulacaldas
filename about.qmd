::: {#about}
Hello! I am María Paula[^name]. Welcome to my blog (or _bitácora_). I am a passionate [{{< fa brands r-project title="R">}}](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) user, programmer and [trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).

I work at the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/) helping develop policy-relevant metrics at the local level. In the past, I worked as a data scientist and economics consultant.

In my spare time, I like contributing to community-driven projects. I have presented for [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) chapters, reviewed for [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), and helped translate [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book to [Spanish](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/).

:::

[^name]: My given name, *María Paula*, is a hispanic composite name, so the two words are used as a unit.
