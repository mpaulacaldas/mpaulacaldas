## About me

<img src="/github-profile.png" style="max-width:35%;min-width:40px;float:right;padding:5px;" alt="Profile picture"/>

My name is María Paula. I am a passionate [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](http://www.r-project.org) user and programmer. 
I am also an [RStudio Certified trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).

I currently work at the Regional Analysis and Statistics Unit of the OECD. Previously, I was an economics consultant at Deloitte France, where I used R and Shiny to build analytics tools to study the antitrust effects of major commercial operations. During this time, I led multiple training sessions on R, and helped my team adopt software engineering tools and practices to streamline our workflows.

In my spare time, I like contributing to community-driven projects. Most recently, I was involved in the translation of the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book to [Spanish](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/).

### Fun facts

:hibiscus: I am drawn to poetic cities. I grew up in the city of eternal spring (Medellín), studied in the pink city (Toulouse), and currently live in the city of lights (Paris).

:musical_score: I started learning the piano at the ripe young age of 27, which rekindled my interest in classical music. I go to concerts as often as I can.

:label: My given name is María Paula. It's a composite given name, which means that it is kind of like socks: you always use the pair. This also means that I will most likely not respond to *María* (without the Paula) or *Paula* (without the María).
